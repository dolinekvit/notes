Closures are formed every time a function is created inside another function.
Since React components are just functions, every function created inside forms a closure, including such hooks as `useCallback` and `useRef`.
When a function that forms a closure is called, all the data around it is "frozen", like a snapshot.
To update that data, we need to re-create the "closed" function. This is what dependencies of hooks like `useCallback` allow us to do.
If we miss a dependency, or don't refresh the closed function assigned to `ref.current`, the closure becomes "stale".
We can escape the "stale closure" trap in React by taking advantage of the fact that Ref is a mutable object. We can mutate `ref.current` outside of the stale closure, and then access it inside. Will be the latest data.
