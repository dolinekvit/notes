With Context (or any other Context-like state management library), we can pass data directly from one component to another deep in the render tree without the need to wire it through props.
Passing data in this way can improve the performance of our apps, as we will avoid the re-rendering of all components in between.
Context, however, can be dangerous: all components that use it will re-render if the value in the Context provider changes. This re-render can't be stopped with standard memoization techniques.
To minimize Context re-renders, we should always memoize the value we pass to the provider.
We can split the Context provider into multiple providers to further minimize re-renders. Switching from useState to useReducer can help with this.
Even though we don't have proper selectors for Context, we can imitate their functionality with HOCs and React.memo.
